# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-
Problem Statement 

Most customers do not post a review rating or any comment after purchasing a product which is a challenge for any eCommerce platform to figure out to take some crucial business decisions like how much the product and seller can be relied on.
Consider we go to an eCommerce website to buy some product, The first thing we see is customer rating, what if there are only very few ratings and those are all negative, we would change our mind to not buy the product.
Considering all the ratings what if the seller improvised the product and sold it but the people who bought it, later on, don’t give any ratings because it’s the human tendency to complain about things in the first place rather than appreciate something.
This was just one of many possible scenarios that can impact the business, thus rating prediction is currently being used by most of the eCommerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, etc.
If an eCommerce company predicts whether a customer will like or dislike the product after it gets delivered so that they can recommend more similar or related products, and also, they can decide whether this product must be sold from their end or not, as it can create a very bad impression on their eCommerce website and customers would not like to visit them again.
The objective is centered around predicting customer satisfaction with a product which can be deduced after predicting the product rating a user would rate after he makes a purchase.
